# Javalyzer
A simple modularized Java toolkit for parsing log files to generate visual outputs.

## How To Set Up

The modularized architecture enables each module to be used individually and independently.

<ul>
<li>
To get started change the javalyzer.properties with preferred settings. Initially you will only need to change 
file paths for log and csv files
</li>

<li>
You have to pass the absolute path of that property file as a command line argument whenever you run any of the below 
jars
</li>

<li>
Run Executor Module as long as you want to record the statistics
</li>

<li>
Run the Processor Module to parse the generated log file to csv format
</li>

<li>
Run the CPU Visualizer / Memory Visualizer Modules as needed.
</li>
</ul>
